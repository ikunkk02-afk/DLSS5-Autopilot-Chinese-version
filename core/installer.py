r"""Install engine: 64-bit, 32-bit and DX9 paths.

64-bit layout (next to the game executable):
    <proxy>.dll                 ReShade64.dll  (dxgi.dll or opengl32.dll)
    dlss5-feed.addon64          (feeder route)
    renodx-dlss5.addon64        (feeder / native / bridge routes)
    renodx-dlss.addon64         (renodx route - ShortFuse's SF build)
    nvngx.dll.addon64           (upstream route - neural-upstream, no renodx add-on)
    standalone-dlssnr.addon64   (standalone route - kibblerz's own feed, no renodx add-on)
    nvngx.dll                   (standalone route - the add-on's caller-identity bridge)
    nvngx_dlssnr.dll
    nvngx_dlss.dll
    nvngx_dlssg.dll             (standalone route - frame generation)
    ReShade.ini / ReShadePreset.ini / dlss5-feed.cfg
    reshade-shaders/Shaders/{headers, DLSS5_Feed.fx, lumenite_*.fx}
    reshade-shaders/Shaders/{DLSS5_AIO_Feed.fx, vort_Motion.fx}   (standalone)
    reshade-shaders/Shaders/include/lumenite_*.fxh
    reshade-shaders/Shaders/Includes/vort_*.fxh                    (standalone)
    reshade-shaders/Textures/lumenite_bluenoise256.png
    reshade-shaders/Textures/vort_BlueNoise.png                    (standalone)

32-bit: a 32-bit process cannot load 64-bit NGX, so a helper process is
needed. The game gets 32-bit ReShade + addon32; host64/ holds its own 64-bit
ReShade and all the DLSS parts.

DX9: DXVK translates to Vulkan first, then the 32-bit path applies.

REMIX: none of the above. The mod's own Remix runtime does the work, so the
only things written are inside its `.trex` folder -

    .trex/nvngx_dlssnr.dll      the neural-rendering snippet
    .trex/d3d9.dll              only when swapping the runtime itself
    .trex/remix_nvngx.dll       its caller-identity bridge, same swap

- plus one line in the game's rtx.conf. No ReShade, no add-on, no proxy DLL:
a ReShade proxy in a Remix game's folder crashes it before it draws.
